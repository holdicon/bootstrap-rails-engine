# Twitter Bootstrap for Rails 3
Make [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) into Rails Engine. [Bootstrap-datepicker](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) is also included.

## Version
Bootstrap 2.3
Bootstrap-datepicker (2013/2/25)

## Rails 3.1 or later
Include Gemfile,

    gem 'bootstrap-rails-engine'

Add stylesheets into application.css

    *= require bootstrap/bootstrap
    *= require bootstrap/bootstrap-responsive

Add javascripts into application.js

    //= require bootstrap/bootstrap

## CDN

This gem supports cdn the same as [jquery-rails-cdn](https://github.com/yjchen/jquery-rails-cdn). In the application layout, add

    = bootstrap_javascript_include_tag :default

and 

    = bootstrap_stylesheet_include_tag :default

then remove corresponding lines in application.js and application.css.

## Options

Set :compressed to use minimized library locally like this:

    = bootstrap_javascript_include_tag :default, :compressed => true

Remember to change the assets name in confign/environments/production.rb:

    config.assets.precompile += %w( bootstrap/bootstrap.min.js)
